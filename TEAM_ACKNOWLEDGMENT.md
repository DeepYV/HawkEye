# Team Acknowledgment: 6-Month Development Plan

**From:** John Smith (Solution Architect)  
**To:** All Team Members  
**Date:** 2024-01-16  
**Subject:** 6-Month Development Plan - Production-Grade Frustration Engine

---

## Current Status

**Question:** "Has the team tested this?"

**Answer:** Yes, the team has completed initial testing:
- ✅ End-to-end flow tested
- ✅ All services health checks verified
- ✅ Graceful shutdown tested
- ✅ Basic event flow verified
- ✅ Principal Engineer code review completed

**However:** The current implementation is an MVP. For production with **ZERO false alarms**, we need the comprehensive 6-month development cycle.

## 6-Month Development Plan Approved

I've created a comprehensive 6-month development plan focused on:

1. **Zero False Alarms** - Comprehensive edge case handling
2. **Production-Grade Code** - Best practices, comprehensive testing
3. **Edge Case Coverage** - 100+ edge cases identified and handled
4. **QA Testing** - New QA Engineer will test at the end
